# TODO: Add a check to see if the frontend networks have changed after running Ansible
# This is because we would need to run the playbook again. Current process:
# 1. Create compose file with new network. Network doesn't exist
# 2. Playbook gathers all the frontend networks and then executes docker-compose up -d and creates the network
# 3. Now a check needs to take place if a new network was created. If so, run the playbook again to recreate the dynamic Traefik file
